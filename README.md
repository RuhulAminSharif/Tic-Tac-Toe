# Tic-Tac-Toe
This project is done to design and implement a graphical user interface (GUI) version of the tic-tac-toe game that allows two players to play against each other.

Features : 
1. The game consist of a 3x3 grid displayed using Java Graphics.  
2. The players are able to click on an empty cell of the grid to place their marks (X or O).  
3. The game checks for a winner after each move, and if there is a winner, the game displays a message indicating which player won.  
4. If there is no winner after all cells have been filled, the game displays a message indicating that the game is a draw.  
5. The game continues until there is a winner or the game is a draw.    
6. I implemented a class for the game, a class for the player, a class for the game board, and a class for the GUI.  
7. I included appropriate methods for initializing the game, making a move, checking for a winner, and displaying the game board.  
8. I implemented error checking to ensure that players cannot make invalid moves.  
9. I also implemented a method to allow players to play again if they wish.  
10. I used Java Graphics to display the game board and the X and O marks.
